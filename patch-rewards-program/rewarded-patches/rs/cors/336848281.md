#### Tell us more about the patch

The [Go reference implementation of Certificate Transparency](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go) counts [github.com/rs/cors](github.com/rs/cors), a CORS middleware library, as one of its open-source dependencies. The project [recently updated](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/commit/9b5b39e97764db78eca1ffe0141ab177dbe849fa) from rs/cors v1.10.1 (vulnerable) to rs/cors v1.11.0 (no longer vulnerable thanks to my patch).

My patch consists in processing the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header of CORS-preflight requests in a defensive manner. More specifically, the patch takes advantage of [guarantees from the Fetch standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-unsafe-request-header-names) about legitimate CORS-preflight requests:
- CORS-preflight requests contain at most one `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header;
- The value of that header consists in unique byte-lowercase comma-separated tokens sorted in lexicographical order.

Before my patch was merged, rs/cors middleware would incur excessive heap allocations when processing spoofed preflight requests that include a maliciously long `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header value (but still within [`http.DefaultMaxHeaderBytes`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http.DefaultMaxHeaderBytes)). Such behaviour could be abused by adversaries to make the server run out of memory and crash. Note that, since CORS middleware must sit in front of any authentication for CORS preflight to succeed (because [CORS-preflight request don't carry credentials](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-protocol-and-credentials)), attackers wouldn't even need to be authenticated.

Here are some benchmarks illustrating the effects of my patch; note the dramatic reduction in heap allocations on the line labeled _PreflightAdversarialACRH-8_ :
