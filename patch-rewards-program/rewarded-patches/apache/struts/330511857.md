Description of the Patch

Apache Struts has long been a high-risk framework from a security perspective, primarily due to its reliance on OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language)—a powerful expression language that allows deep object access and mutation. OGNL enables dynamic data binding and logic execution, but when exploited (e.g., through injection), it can lead to critical issues like remote code execution (RCE).

This patch introduces a major uplift to the OGNL evaluation model in Struts via an intelligent allowlist-based sandbox. It addresses both intended OGNL injection points (like parameter deserialization during form submissions) and unintended ones (such as secondary expression evaluations via SSTI vulnerabilities).


---

OGNL Injection Attack Surface in Struts

Struts OGNL vulnerabilities typically arise through:

1. Parameter Deserialization (Intended Injection)

User-submitted form data is bound to fields via OGNL.

A RegEx filter limits syntax but still permits dangerous paths.



2. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI / Double Evaluation)

OGNL expressions evaluated internally with full syntax capabilities.

No sanitization or restrictions by default.





---

Key Improvements

1. Intelligent Class Allowlist
Struts previously used an exclusion-based filter for dangerous classes during OGNL evaluation. This was brittle and incomplete. This patch replaces it with a pre-seeded allowlist populated with safe Struts core classes, and then dynamically extended using:

The application’s XML configuration files.

New method-level annotations (see below).


The allowlist ensures only explicitly permitted classes are accessible, dramatically reducing the OGNL attack surface.

2. Explicit Annotation-Based Parameter Binding
Struts Action classes often mix business logic and user-bound fields, making it easy to expose sensitive objects. This patch introduces a new method-level annotation to explicitly declare deserialization points.

Prevents accidental exposure of internal fields or getters.

Ensures OGNL only follows safe, developer-approved binding paths.

Works in tandem with the allowlist to detect additional needed classes automatically.


This mechanism improves upon prior (optional and ineffective) efforts like AnnotationParameterFilterInterceptor by securing not just fields, but access paths through methods and nested objects.


---

Security Impact

This sandboxing model radically improves Struts’ resilience against OGNL-based exploits. Even if injection occurs, the attacker is constrained to a tightly scoped set of safe classes, eliminating typical escalation paths to RCE.

Recent real-world vulnerabilities in Struts-based applications (e.g., Atlassian Confluence) would have been fully mitigated by this patch. Examples include:

CVE-2023-22515

CVE-2024-21672

CVE-2024-21673

CVE-2024-21674


The patch is already in testing and will ship as an opt-in feature in Struts 6.4.0, and enabled by default in Struts 7.0.0.


---

Summary

This patch fundamentally reshapes how OGNL is evaluated in Struts, offering:

A secure-by-default allowlist model.

Precise developer control over deserialization points.

Substantial hardening against one of the most historically dangerous classes of vulnerabilities in Java web frameworks.


It represents one of the most significant security advancements in Struts since its inception.

#### Tell us more about the patch

Apache Struts has historically been plagued by the most critical vulnerabilities, often remote code executions. This is due to its use of OGNL, a powerful expression language, which enables many of its key features. Due to OGNL’s capabilities, if a bad actor is able to achieve arbitrary expression injection, it is often trivial to escalate to an RCE. Some previous framework design decisions also mean that exploitation paths are often introduced inadvertently by Struts-based web developers not familiar with the Struts framework’s inner workings.

OGNL expression injection based vulnerabilities in Struts have usually been achieved in 2 ways:
1. By leveraging Struts’ parameter deserialization mechanism. This is an intended OGNL expression injection point for users, whereby DTO classes are populated with user/form data. The OGNL expressions used for this purpose are sanitised using a RegEx which limits the OGNL syntax capabilities. However, these expressions still prove dangerous as will be explained later.
2. By exploiting a potential SSTI vulnerability (sometimes known as a double evaluation). In such a scenario, no RegEx based sanitisation takes place as internal OGNL evaluations are intended to leverage all OGNL syntax capabilities.

This patch submission addresses serious security concerns with both the parameter deserializing **intended** OGNL expression injection point, as well as any **unintended** injection points.

Struts already had a class exclusion list mechanism for evaluating OGNL expressions. Whilst this exclusion list contained the most obvious classes that could be used maliciously, it required proactive application-specific maintenance to ensure any sensitive application beans or library classes capable of privileged operations were included on this list. Often it might not be apparent that a certain class could pose a threat as an exploit gadget until an exploit had already occurred.

The most obvious solution here was to introduce a class allow list in place of the exclusion list. However, obtaining a list of all classes needed on such an allow list would prove an equally rigorous endeavour, and the aim here was to have this capability enabled by default for all Struts applications and minimise maintenance burden. Most Struts applications loaded their configuration from an XML file. By having a pre-populated allow list consisting of necessary Struts library classes and then supplementing it with relevant classes while loading a specific application’s XML configuration, the vast majority of classes needed for a fully functional Struts application could be achieved.

For most Struts applications, the only remaining classes that were missing
from the allow list were their form submission DTO classes. Struts has the
concept of Action classes which contains the business logic for serving and
handling web pages, as well as any fields or nested classes to where form
submission parameters can be deserialized. Struts' parameter
deserialization mechanism can be used to set user-controlled data on ANY
public member on the Action class. Given business logic cohabits this
class, it becomes painfully easy to accidentally expose a sensitive
application bean which is then completely open to user mutation.

Struts has never required the explicit declaration of methods/fields
intended for parameter deserialization and thereby clearly separating them
from other methods/fields in the Action class. There was previously an
attempt to introduce such a mechanism
(AnnotationParameterFilterInterceptor) but it was entirely optional, did
not block parameters by default, and its field-based annotation mechanism
was ineffective for many exploitable scenarios (such as a getter returning
an object that doesn't correspond to a field).

Thus, in this patch I additionally introduce a method-based annotation
which is used to explicitly declare parameter deserialization points,
clearly marking the invocation path that OGNL takes. Any user attempt at
setting a parameter value on a member not intended for deserialization will
be discarded. This annotation mechanism synergises with the earlier
introduced allow list. Using the annotations I could detect and load the
final classes needed in the allow list, making it completely
configuration-less for most Struts application developers. Even if OGNL
expression injection via an SSTI is achieved (where most OGNL syntax
capabilities are available to an attacker), there are now a very limited
number of classes that can be invoked, if an access path even exists.

Implementing the overall patch required the use of numerous creative techniques and a deep understanding of the inner workings of both Struts and OGNL. I additionally dealt with complexities related to bean injection, as managed by the pre-release version of Guice bundled with Struts, and rectifying many existing bugs and suboptimal patterns. Please refer to the linked PRs and full diffs for further details.

In recent months, Atlassian’s Confluence Data Center, which is built upon Apache Struts, was subject to multiple Critical and High rated vulnerabilities. These were shown to have been completely preventable by the capabilities introduced in this patch. Specific PoCs and detailed explanations on how this patch would have thwarted these CVEs can be provided upon request.

Critical/High CVEs preventable by this patch:
* CVE-2023-22515
* CVE-2024-21672
* CVE-2024-21673
* CVE-2024-21674

I do believe this patch to be one of the greatest uplifts to Struts’ security posture since its inception. Whilst the Struts framework may be waning in popularity since its peak well over a decade ago, this patch ensures applications built upon Struts can be trusted to experience a much higher level of security. It is already available in test builds and will be officially released in the upcoming Struts 6.4.0 as an opt-in capability, and enabled by default in Struts 7.0.0.
